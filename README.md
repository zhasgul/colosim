Colo-Sim (Colorectal cancer Simulation model), a dynamic compartmental population-based model, representing disease progression, screening, and diagnosis. It considers early detection constraints often observed LMIC's for including restricted access to care and low colonoscopy capacity.

The .rar file includes two Stella files. The model file (.STMX) contains the information that defines the model, such as its entities, equations, interface objects, documentation, and page layout information. The database file (.ISDB) contains the simulation run data for the model.

The Excel file includes raw data used for calibration as well as the projections.

An online interface to run the model without any software requirement is also available at: https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/zhasgul/colosim
